# Snake Game

## What is this?

- A snake game made with simple html canvas.

## What can you do with this?

- You can set difficulty (Easy, Normal, Hard) as well as game mode (Original, Modern). In Modern game mode, game still continues when the snake hit the wall. Specifically, it will go through from the opposite wall.

## Known Bugs

- Restart in the middle of the game doesn't work at the moment.
- Currently has problem with the frame (since the frame and the input are not synchronyzed)
